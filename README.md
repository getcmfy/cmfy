> CMFY is still pre-production, means it's highly not recommended to use it on production apps. However - since it's just a boilerplate - it's not a huge issue if you want to use it.

## Quick Start

### Requirements

Minimum Requirements :

NodeJS 12.x
NPM 6.x / Yarn 1.x
degit by [Rich Harris](https://twitter.com/rich_harris) ( for installation, see [degit](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/degit))

Recommended Requirements :

NodeJS 14.x
NPM 6.x / yarn 1.x
degit by [Rich Harris](https://twitter.com/rich_harris) ( for installation, see [degit](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/degit))

### Download

To Download, we recommend **degit** instead of normal `git clone` commands.

`npx degit tsanyqudsi/cmfy my-app`

We use `degit` because it's fast and we have [degit.json](https://github.com/tsanyqudsi/cmfy/blob/master/degit.json) that should delete most of "unneeded" files.
