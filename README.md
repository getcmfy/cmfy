## Quick Start

To Quick Start, we recommend **degit** instead of normal `git clone` commands. 

`npx degit tsanyqudsi/cmfy#main my-app`

We use `degit` because it's fast and we have ([degit.json](https://github.com/tsanyqudsi/cmfy/blob/master/degit.json)) that should delete most of "unneeded" files.
