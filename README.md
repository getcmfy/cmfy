> CMFY is still pre-production, means it's highly not recommended to use it on production apps. However - since it's just a boilerplate - it's not a huge issue if you want to use it.

## Requirements

Minimum Requirements :

- NodeJS 12.x
- NPM 6.x / Yarn 1.x

Recommended Requirements :

- NodeJS 14.x
- NPM 6.x / yarn 1.x

Optional ( but recommended ) :

- degit by [Rich Harris](https://twitter.com/rich_harris) ( for installation, see [degit](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/degit))

## Quick Start

### Download

To Download, we recommend **degit** instead of normal `git clone` commands.

`npx degit tsanyqudsi/cmfy my-app` ( Change my-app to whatever directory you want to use )

We use `degit` because it's fast and we have [degit.json](https://github.com/tsanyqudsi/cmfy/blob/master/degit.json) that should delete most of "unneeded" files.
